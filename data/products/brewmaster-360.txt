BrewMaster 360 is a fictional countertop espresso and drip hybrid. It uses a 1.6L removable water tank, a 19-bar pump for espresso mode, and a stainless steel boiler with a 12-minute warm-up. A front dial switches between espresso, drip, and steam.

For espresso, the recommended dose is 18-20 grams of medium-fine coffee with a 1:2 ratio. The machine ships with a single-wall portafilter basket and a pressurized basket for pre-ground coffee. Steam mode uses a manual wand with a rubber grip.

Maintenance guidance: run a rinse cycle after each use. Descale every 6-8 weeks for hard water, using a citric-acid solution. Remove and clean the shower screen monthly. The drip filter should be replaced every 3 months or after 90 brews.

Noise level is listed as 68 dB during pump operation. The drip carafe is 10 cups. Auto shutoff is set to 20 minutes. The machine includes a cup warmer plate and a programmable brew timer.

Safety notes: do not run the pump without water, keep the steam wand clear of milk residue, and allow the boiler to cool for 10 minutes before descaling.
