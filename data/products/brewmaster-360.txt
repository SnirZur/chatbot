BrewMaster 360 is a fictional countertop espresso and drip hybrid. It uses a 1.6L removable water tank, a 19-bar pump for espresso mode, and a stainless steel boiler with a 12-minute warm-up. A front dial switches between espresso, drip, and steam.

For espresso, the recommended dose is 18-20 grams of medium-fine coffee with a 1:2 ratio. The machine ships with a single-wall portafilter basket and a pressurized basket for pre-ground coffee. Steam mode uses a manual wand with a rubber grip.

Maintenance guidance: run a rinse cycle after each use. Descale every 6-8 weeks for hard water, using a citric-acid solution. Remove and clean the shower screen monthly. The drip filter should be replaced every 3 months or after 90 brews.

Noise level is listed as 68 dB during pump operation. The drip carafe is 10 cups. Auto shutoff is set to 20 minutes. The machine includes a cup warmer plate and a programmable brew timer.

Safety notes: do not run the pump without water, keep the steam wand clear of milk residue, and allow the boiler to cool for 10 minutes before descaling.

The control panel includes a pressure gauge, a shot timer, and a backlit water-level indicator. Espresso temperature is factory set to 93°C and can be adjusted in a three-step range. A pre-infusion stage runs for 3 seconds to reduce channeling.

The drip side supports a reusable metal filter basket as well as standard paper cones. Brew strength has three settings: light, balanced, and bold. The programmable timer allows scheduling up to 24 hours in advance.

Steam performance: the wand reaches full pressure in about 25 seconds and maintains steady output for 60-90 seconds before a short recovery period. Milk foam is best with 150-200 ml volumes. The wand tip is removable for cleaning.

Energy specs list 1450 W peak draw. The warm-up cycle can be shortened using the quick-heat mode, which reduces boiler stability slightly but saves about 3 minutes.

Common troubleshooting: if shots run too fast, use a finer grind or increase dose; if too slow, coarsen the grind. For weak crema, check bean freshness and pre-heat the portafilter. For drip under-extraction, raise brew temperature by one step.

Recommended water hardness is 50-120 ppm. A built-in reminder light prompts descaling after 60 cycles, and can be reset by holding the brew timer button for 5 seconds.
