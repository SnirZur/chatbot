VoltRider E2 is a fictional compact electric car with a 62 kWh battery pack and an estimated range of 420 km in mixed city/highway conditions. It supports DC fast charging up to 150 kW and AC home charging up to 11 kW. A 10-80% fast charge is advertised at 28 minutes under optimal conditions.

Performance specs include 0-100 km/h in 6.9 seconds and a top speed limited to 160 km/h. The drivetrain is rear-wheel drive with 210 kW peak power and 350 Nm torque. Regenerative braking has three levels plus a one-pedal mode.

Interior features include a 15-inch center display, OTA software updates, and a driver assistance suite called LaneGuard. LaneGuard offers adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping, and auto-emergency braking.

Climate efficiency features include a heat pump, pre-conditioning via mobile app, and seat heaters in the front row. The cabin storage is 410 liters in the rear plus a 40-liter front trunk.

Recommended tire pressure is 38 PSI. The manual suggests checking tire wear every 10,000 km and running a battery health check once per year.

Charging guidance: use DC fast charging when the battery is between 20-60% for optimal speed. For daily use, AC home charging to 80% is recommended to preserve long-term battery health. The charge port is on the front-left fender with an LED ring that shows charge status.

Infotainment includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus a built-in navigation system with live traffic. The audio system has 8 speakers and a cabin noise reduction mode that reduces road noise at highway speeds.

Safety features include 8 airbags, a tire pressure monitoring system, and automatic high-beam headlights. LaneGuard can be customized for steering sensitivity and following distance.

Winter performance notes: pre-conditioning the cabin while plugged in can improve range. The heat pump reduces energy use by up to 20% in mild cold weather but is less effective below -10°C.

Service intervals are every 20,000 km or 12 months. Brake pads typically last longer due to regenerative braking, but rotor inspection is still recommended at each service visit.
