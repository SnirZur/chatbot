EvoPhone X is a fictional flagship smartphone built around a 6.6-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 2400x1080 resolution. The device uses an AeroCore A9 chipset with 8 GB or 12 GB of RAM and storage options of 128 GB or 256 GB. The chassis is aluminum with GorillaGlass-like protection and an IP68 water resistance rating.

Battery capacity is 4,800 mAh. Typical mixed-use battery life is listed as 24 hours, with video playback up to 18 hours. The device supports 45W wired fast charging and 15W wireless charging. A full wired charge is advertised at around 55 minutes with a compatible charger.

The camera system includes a 50 MP main sensor with optical image stabilization, a 12 MP ultra-wide lens, and an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The front camera is 16 MP. The phone supports 4K video at 60 fps and a low-light mode called NightPulse.

Connectivity includes 5G sub-6, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and NFC. Dual-SIM is supported (one physical SIM plus one eSIM). The EvoPhone X runs OrionOS 5.1 with a promised three years of major updates.

Common notes from the manual: keep the device between 0-35°C while charging, avoid using third-party high-watt chargers over 65W, and enable Battery Guard mode for long-term storage.

Display tuning options include Natural, Vivid, and Cinema profiles, plus a nighttime reading mode that reduces blue light. The touch panel supports 240 Hz touch sampling for gaming. A GorillaGlass-like layer covers the display and the rear glass panel to improve scratch resistance.

Audio features include stereo speakers with a spatial sound mode and three microphones for noise suppression during calls. The included USB-C earbuds support an inline microphone and volume controls. Hi-Res audio over Bluetooth is supported via AAC and LDAC.

Biometric security options include an in-display fingerprint sensor and face unlock. The fingerprint sensor supports up to five enrolled fingerprints and has a quick unlock toggle that reduces lock-screen animations.

The box contents list a USB-C cable, a 45W charger, a SIM eject tool, and a clear protective case. Optional accessories include a magnetic wallet, a 10,000 mAh power bank, and a ruggedized case rated for 2-meter drops.

Diagnostic and care tips: run the built-in Storage Cleaner weekly, keep at least 10% free storage to avoid UI slowdowns, and update OrionOS before major app installs. If the phone overheats, disable 5G and reduce screen brightness for 10 minutes.

Warranty coverage is 24 months for the handset and 6 months for the battery. Screen replacements are discounted once per year through the official service program. Water damage is not covered if seals are compromised.
