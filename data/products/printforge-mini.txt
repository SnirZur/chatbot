PrintForge Mini is a fictional desktop 3D printer with a 180 x 180 x 180 mm build volume. It uses an FDM extruder with a 0.4 mm nozzle and supports PLA, PETG, and TPU. The printer has a heated bed up to 90°C and a direct-drive extruder.

Recommended print speed is 40-80 mm/s, with maximum 120 mm/s for rough prototypes. Layer heights between 0.12 and 0.28 mm are supported. The printer includes auto bed leveling with a 9-point probe.

Connectivity options include USB-C and Wi-Fi. Prints can be uploaded via a local web dashboard. The onboard screen is a 3.5-inch color touch panel. Firmware updates are delivered over Wi-Fi.

Maintenance notes: clean the nozzle every 100 print hours, re-tension belts every 3 months, and lubricate Z-axis rods quarterly. The manual warns to keep the printer in a dust-free environment and to avoid drafts during ABS printing.

The print bed uses a textured spring-steel plate for easy part removal. A flexible magnetic base allows quick swaps between plates. The printer ships with a spare nozzle and a 50g spool of PLA.

Filament handling: recommended spool diameter is up to 200 mm, and the side-mount holder supports up to 1 kg spools. The extruder path includes a filament runout sensor and a manual tension lever.

Quality presets include Draft, Standard, and Fine, with default layer heights of 0.28 mm, 0.20 mm, and 0.12 mm respectively. Retraction defaults to 0.8 mm at 35 mm/s for PLA, with slightly lower values for TPU to avoid jams.

Bed adhesion tips: use a light coat of glue stick for PETG, and a brim for tall prints. The printer supports automatic brim generation in the slicer profile. The maximum bed temperature for PLA is 60°C.

Recovery features include power-loss resume and a pause-at-layer function for multi-color prints. The printer also supports time-lapse capture via a USB webcam connection.
